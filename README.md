# RespondendoBeecrowd

Welcome to my repository of solutions for Beecrowd problems! Here, you'll find code in Python, C, and Java that solves various problems from the Beecrowd platform. This repository serves as a record of my progress and learning, as well as a reference for anyone studying or practicing competitive programming.

## About Beecrowd

[Beecrowd](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/) (formerly URI Online Judge) is a platform that offers a vast collection of programming problems to practice and improve your coding skills. The problems vary in difficulty and cover a wide range of topics, including algorithms, data structures, mathematics, and more.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Python**: Solutions written in Python.
- **C**: Solutions written in C.
- **Java**: Solutions written in Java.

Inside each folder, files are named according to the problem number on Beecrowd. For example, the problem `1001 - Extremely Basic` will have a file named `1001.py`, `1001.c`, or `1001.java`, depending on the language.
